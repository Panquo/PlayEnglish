                PlayEnglish is a fictious website created for an english project. This project was initiated by english teachers of the Engineering school of TelecomNancy in France. The goal was to create an IT tool to help people learn english. In our case, we decided to create a website including various types of fun games to learn and revise english vocabulary.
